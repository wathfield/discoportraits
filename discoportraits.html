Disco Portraits is a photographic collection of party identities.<br /><br />
It deals with the queastion why we have to create so many different identities in order to function and be perceived, and why are these conventions location-bound?
What does a set of accessories do to us that we think it will make us a 'cooler' or more interesting person?<br /><br />
I discovered that this phenomenon also applys to me; I want to fit in, but want to be seen. I want to be crazy, but feel respected. It is about exploring my own identities that I, depended on the location, feel compftable with.<br /><br />
The basis for the creation of the different identities is a python based program. From several lists in which all attributes are stored, the program dices the attributes together and distributes them in consideration with the fixed occurrence probability on hundred individual lists. The result is a collection of identities, where the first one is the most special and the last one is the most average. The 'rarer' the character, the more special the mask and costume.<br /><br />The interactive version is still very alpha and can until now only be used in the terminal. Feel free to try it out!
